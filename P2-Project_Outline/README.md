## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I intend to create a web app for knitting/crochet. There is one app that already exists that man users find fault with.
I'd like to make a space where users can share their projects, ideas, patterns, and thoughts with other users, as well as
make libraries of projects or patterns they like or may want to try in the future. This web app will also allow users to
build image/text catalogues of their yarn and tools. It will allow users to discuss patterns, yarns, projects, and topics
related to these needlework hobbies.


### Features
User Login - Users will have a verified login consisting of their name, a username, and password which link to an outside email.

Search - Web app will contain a search feature allowing users to find other users/yarns/patterns/projects

Upload project - This feature will allow users to upload images of a personal project/finished object along with a space
for a text description and project notes such as yarn and needles used

Browse - Users will be able to use keywords to browse a collection of patterns created by other users

Stash - Users will be able to catalogue their personal collections of yarn with pictures and a description


### Technologies
